A cheap and easy way to VR.

Simplo VR is a cheap virtual reality headset with 6-dof and support for steamvr. made for the community by the community, simplo is the easiest way to enter in the virtual reality worlds without paying a fortune...

We gonna try our best to develop a headset with 6-dof tracking, maybe hand tracking and a lot of stuff to make the project not only one of the cheapest ways to enter vr, but one of the better ones!

Made with easy to find components and full open-source to be modified, improved and tested.
